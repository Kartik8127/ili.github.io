                        From the last second semesters, students become eligible for campus placement. Placement cells are active and improving over years. There are lots of steam companies that are visiting such as Byjus, Infosys, nestle, Wipro and some gulf companies etc. The average package offered is 3-4 LPA and the highest Package is 17-20 LPA. Those gulf companies offer 12-15 LPA. There are no minimum criteria for students sitting in placements it depends upon the companies norms. My plan after getting the degree is the job.
